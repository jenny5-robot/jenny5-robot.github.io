<p>Jenny 5 is an (almost) humanoid robot intended to be used mainly for research but also as a human assistant. </p>

<p>Jenny 5 was inspired by the Johnny 5 robot from the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091949/">Short circuit</a> movie. This a great movie that anyone must see.</p>

<p>Jenny 5 has a mobile platform with tracks, a pliable leg, two arms with 7 degrees of freedom each and one head</p>

<p>All source files (CAD, software etc) for Jenny 5 are freely available on <a href = "https://github.com/jenny5-robot">GitHub</a>. All code is released under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">MIT license</a> so that anyone can freely use it in both personal and commercial applications.</p>

<p>Jenny 5 is easy and cheap to build. Most components can be purchased from robotics stores. Custom made parts can be printed with a 3D printer. Some aluminium profiles can be cut and drilled with tools available for hobbyists.</p> 

<p>Materials (excepting the computer) cost about 2500 USD (please see the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SwaC4woJEvUEqn66lIG9MLYkuADfTsWIQtvDKaCQT1s/edit?usp=sharing">Bill of materials</a> for more details).</p>

<p>Jenny 5 is designed in <a href="http://www.openscad.org">OpenSCAD</a> which is a CAD software where you write instructions, instead of using the mouse, to create objects.</p>

<p>The platform is driven by 2 DC motors with planetary gearbox controlled by a <a href="https://www.basicmicro.com/">RoboClaw</a> board.</p>

<p>The leg is driven by 2 linear motors controlled by a RoboClaw board.</p>

<p>Each arm has 6 stepper motors and each joint has attached a magnetic sensor for reading its position. Motors and sensors are controlled by an <a href = "https://www.pololu.com/product/3145">A-Star 32U4 Mini</a> board.</p>

<p>The gripper is powered by a servor motor. The gripper is connected to the same A-Star 32U4 Mini board as the entire arm. Gripper has attached an webcam used for recognising objects closed to it.</p>

<p>The head has 2 degrees of freedom ensured by 2 stepper motors which have magnetic attached for reading the position. The head has a webcam for object detection and an ultrasonic sensor for distance measurement. All head components, except the camera, are connected to an <a href = "https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-nano">Arduino Nano</a> board.</p>

<p>The entire robot is powered by 2 LiPo batteries: one for platform and foot and one for arms and head.</p>

<p>A-Star / Arduino boards run a specially crafted firmware called <a href="https://github.com/jenny5-robot/Scufy">Scufy</a> which is able to control multiple stepper motors and read a variety of sensors: buttons, ultrasonic, potentiometers, infrared, LIDAR etc.</p>

<p>PC software is built around several libraries which send commands, on a serial port, to A-Star/ Arduino boards and to the RoboClaw controller.</p>

The robot can be manually controlled by an HTML5 application running within browser  on  a  smartphone. The  HTML5  application  connects  with  a  server running on the robot. The server is the one that actually execute the commands(move, read sensors) etc. The server is built on a top of a light WebSocket server.

<p>Having all these elements, the robot can be utilised in a wide range of scenarios. Here are a short list of things that the robot could do (if programmed correctly):</p>


<ul>

<li>House cleaning</li>

<li>Food preparation</li>

<li>Cleaning kitchen table</li>

<li>Working in the garden</li>

<li>Surveillance</li>

<li>Rescue</li>

<li>Disaster management</li>

<li>Fire fighting</li>

<li>...</li>

</ul>
