<p>Jenny 5 is an (almost) humanoid robot intended to be used mainly for research but also as a human assistant. </p>

<p>Jenny 5 was inspired by the Johnny 5 robot from the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091949/">Short circuit</a> movie. This a great movie that anyone must see.</p>

<p>Jenny 5 has a mobile platform with tracks, a pliable leg, two arms with 6 degrees of freedom each, one head and one LIDAR.</p>

<p>All source files (CAD, software etc) for Jenny 5 are freely available on <a href = "https://github.com/jenny5-robot">GitHub</a>. All code is released under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">MIT license</a> so that anyone can freely use it in both personal and commercial applications.</p>

<p>Jenny 5 is easy and cheap to build. Most components can be purchased from robotics stores. Custom made parts can be printed with a 3D printer. Some aluminium profiles can be cut and drilled with tools available for hobbyists.</p> 

<p>Materials (excepting the computer and webcams) cost about 1500 USD (please see the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SwaC4woJEvUEqn66lIG9MLYkuADfTsWIQtvDKaCQT1s/edit?usp=sharing">Bill of materials</a> for more details).</p>

<p>Jenny 5 is designed in <a href="http://www.openscad.org">OpenSCAD</a> which is a CAD software where you write instructions, instead of using the mouse, to create objects.</p>

<p>The platform is driven by 2 DC motors with planetary gearbox controlled by a <a href="http://www.ionmc.com">RoboClaw</a> board.</p>

<p>The leg is driven by 2 linear motors controlled by a RoboClaw board.</p>

<p>LIDAR consists of a <a href = "http://www.teraranger.com/">TeraRanger One</a> sensor, a stepper motor and infrared distance sensor (used as reference). All components are controlled by an Arduino Nano board.</p>

<p>Each arm has 5 stepper motors and each joint has attached a potentiometer for reading its position. Motors and sensors are controlled again by an Arduino Nano board.</p>

<p>The gripper is moved by a linear stepper motor and the closed position is determined with the help of a button. The gripper is connected to the same Arduino board as the entire arm. Gripper has attached an webcam used for recognising objects closed to it.</p>

<p>The head has 2 degrees of freedom ensured by 2 stepper motors which have potentiometers attached for reading the position. The head has a webcam for object detection and an ultrasonic sensor for distance measurement. All head components, except the camera, are connected to an Arduino Nano board.</p>

<p>The entire robot is powered by 3 LiPo batteries: one for platform and foot, one for arms and head, and one for the LIDAR sensor.</p>

<p>Arduino boards run a specially crafted firmware called <a href="https://github.com/jenny5-robot/jenny5-firmware">Jenny5-firmware</a> which is able to control multiple stepper motors and read a variety of sensors: buttons, ultrasonic, potentiometers, infrared, LIDAR etc.</p>

<p>PC software is built around several libraries which send commands, on a serial port, to Arduino boards and to the RoboClaw controller.</p>


<p>Having all these elements, the robot can be utilised in a wide range of scenarios. Here are a short list of things that the robot could do (if programmed correctly):</p>


<ul>

<li>House cleaning</li>

<li>Food preparation</li>

<li>Cleaning kitchen table</li>

<li>Working in the garden</li>

<li>Surveillance</li>

<li>Rescue</li>

<li>Disaster management</li>

<li>Fire fighting</li>

<li>...</li>

</ul>

<p>Jenny 5 is currently developed within the <a href="http://www.uab.ro">1 Decembrie 1918 University of Alba-Iulia, Romania</a></p>
